Day 02 – Flappy Bird (Unity 2D)

This game is my second project in the 10 Days – 10 Games challenge, where I build a complete small game each day to improve my Unity and C# skills.
Day 02 is a full Flappy Bird clone featuring responsive movement, scoring, obstacles, UI, and game flow systems.

🕹 Gameplay Overview

You control a small bird that continuously falls due to gravity. Tap or press space to make it jump upward and navigate through randomly generated pipe gaps. Each successful gap gives 1 point. Colliding with any pipe or the ground ends the game.
