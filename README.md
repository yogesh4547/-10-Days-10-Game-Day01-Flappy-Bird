Day 02 – Flappy Bird (Unity 2D)

This is my second project in the 10 Days – 10 Games Challenge, where I build a complete small game each day to improve my Unity, C#, and overall game development workflow.

Day 02 is a fully featured Flappy Bird clone, including polished movement, procedural pipes, UI systems, scoring, and smooth game flow.

🕹 Gameplay Overview

You control a small bird affected by gravity. Tap or press space to flap upward and navigate through the gaps between incoming pipes.
Each passed gap awards 1 point.
Hitting a pipe or the ground causes an immediate Game Over.
